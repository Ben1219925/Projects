hw10.c
    write a program that takes 3 command line arguments
    input filename
    output filename
    buffer size (int)
    allocate a buffer of floats of the given size
    fill a circular buffer from the input file
    for each remaining value in the input file, rotate the data into a circular buffer and calculate the average of the values in the buffer
    write that average value to the output file
    "%f\n"
    count the values in the input file and print it to stdout
    "Input file contains %d values\n"
    count the values written to the output file and print it to stdout
    "Wrote %d values to output file\n"
Plotting with gnuplot
    use gnuplot to plot the data in the input file and the output file on the same graph.
    create a plot script in /src named "plot.gnu" and make it executable.
