hw03a.py Solves the quadratic equation for an equation of the form Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0
  Function that takes the coefficients A,B,C and returns the solutions as a tuple.
  it works with real and complex solutions

hw03b.py Creates arrays to hold 5 student names and 5 grades.  Fill them in from this table (in order)
  Larry	75
  Moe	85
  Curly	65
  Sleepy	48
  Happy	98
  print the name and score of all students in alphabetical order by name
  <name>\t<grade>\n
  print the name and score of all students in the order or increasing grade
  <name>\t<grade>\n

hw03c.py  The current through a diode is given by ID = IS[e^(q*VD/n*k*T)-1]
  where:
    n=ideality constant,
    k=Boltzmanns constant = 
    T is temperature in Kelvin
    q is the electron charge = 
 
  Write a function diodeCurrent(Vd,Is,T,n) which returns the diode current.
  print the results as:  "Id = <Id> for vd = <vd><\n"  in scientific notation with 3 places of precision after the decimal.

hw03d.py  Given two equations: Ax+By+C and Dx+Ey=F
 where A-F are variables, write a program that solves the equations in general. 
Write a function solve(A,B,C,D,E,F) which returns the solution as a tuple (x,y)
write a main function that tests it on A=2, B=5, C=7,D=4,E=-6,F=12
print the result as "x = <x>\ty = <y>\n" as floats with 2 decimals
