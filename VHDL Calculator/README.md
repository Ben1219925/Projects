This project is a fully functional calculator with operations: add, subtract, multiply, load, and hold from user input and memory.
This was done using a state-machine to function as the controller, a 16x8 memory with a memory interface, a debouncing pulse circuit, an address bus, an ALU, and an accumulator.
Fully functions on the Basys 3 FPGA.

The original VHDL Code has been lost, but modules using the included code can be written and implemented.
