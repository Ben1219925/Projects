This project is a culmination of 3 difffernet communication projects.

The project is designed to accept an ascii key entered into the Python program that will be interpreted by the controller and execute a specific command:
0: stop transmitting
2: display the data being read from the ADC by the i2c communication protocol using data from 6 switches
3: display the data being read from the ADC by the i2c communication protocol using a sin wave saved to the block memory
4: display the data being sent to the DAC by the spi communication protocol using data from 6 switches
5: display the data being sent to the DAC by the spi communication protocol using a sin wave saved to the block memory
8: display the current state of the controllers for the i2c and spi using data from 6 switches
9: display the current state of the controllers for the i2c and spi using a sin wave saved to the block memory

These commands will light up 6 lights on the FPGA and will also graph the voltage on a python plot.

All communication protocols were hand constructed, including the UART receiver and transmitter, spi, and i2c.
Details on the project are found in the specs PDF.
